**osu!Arena** is a custom-built, real-time Discord bot designed for the **osu! community** at osu!Arena. It manages league sessions, rivalries, challenges, player verification, and rank syncing for a competitive community racing to reach 4-digit osu! global rank and beyond.

---

## Ongoing

Project refactoring and cleanup are currently in progress on the cleanup branch.

---

## Recent (Dec 25 2025)

- Added /delete command that forcefully deletes a player from the database
- Added a mechanism that automatically deletes a player from the database when they leave the Server
- Everytime the bot starts up, it now first looks for any users in database and not in server, and deletes them

---

## Features

- **osu! Account Linking** – Secure OAuth2-based account verification via website.
- **League System** – Automatically assigns users into leagues (Bronze → Master) based on osu! rank.
- **Rivalry & Challenge System** – Issue & manage direct 1v1 challenges with real-time updates.
- **Live PP & Rank Updates** – Every player’s rank & pp is updated constantly in the database.
- **Session Resets** – Admins can restart sessions to reassign league brackets.
- **Archived Seasons & Challenges** – Access previous seasons and completed rivalries via `/archived` command.
- **Winner Announcements** – Rivalry winners are automatically detected and announced.
- **Asynchronous Architecture** – Uses `asyncio` and parallel modules for optimal performance.
- **OAuth Landing Page** – Hosted with Railway to handle account linking & redirection.

---

## Commands (Help Menu)

The bot uses **slash commands** for a cleaner experience. Here’s what you can do:

---

### `/link`

Link your osu! account securely via OAuth2.  
_All users signed up before **June 18, 2025, 22:50 CDT** were linked manually._

---

### `/show [league]`

Shows the table for a specific league.

- **league**: Available League names: Novice, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Elite, Ranker(deprecated), Master
- Other miscellaneous table to be accesed: Rivals, Points, S_points.  
  Examples:
- `/show league:Bronze`
- `/show league:Silver`
- `/show league:Rivals`

---

### `/archived [season] [league]`

View archived tables from previous seasons or finished challenges.

- **season**: Season number (integer).
- **league**: League name (e.g., Bronze, Silver, Gold, Rivals, S_points).
- **Note**: `season:0` is the only valid value for `leag:Rivals`.
  Only `season:1` available for Ranker league
  Seasonal_point archives starts from `season:3`
  Archives unavailable for universal points

Examples:

- `/archived season:1 leag:Bronze`
- `/archived season:0 leag:Rivals`
- `/archived season:3 leag:S_points`(when `season:3` ends)

Works only for **finished** seasons and challenges.

---

### `/challenge @user <pp>`

Challenge a player in your league for a match.

- Max **3 active** challenges
- PP must be **250–750**
- You can’t challenge the same player **more than once a day**
- The challenged player gets a DM to accept/decline
- Challenge only valid for 10 mins, gets revoked if not responded within time limit

Example:  
`/challenge player:@Rhythmic_Ocean pp:700`

---

### `/revoke_challenge @user`

Revoke a pending challenge you issued.

- Only **unaccepted (pending)** challenges can be revoked
- If the challenge has been accepted, it **cannot** be revoked

Example:  
`/revoke_challenge player:@Rhythmic_Ocean`

---

### `/session_restart`

Admin-only command to reset the current session, create backups and reassign users to leagues.

---

### `/points @user points`

Restricted to be used by Admin and Speed-rank-judge only
Can add/ remove points for any user
Effects both seasonal and universal points

---

/delete @user

Admin-only command to forcefully delete a player from the database.

- Wipes all user data (including Rivals history, scores, etc)
- Strips all current league roles and assigns the Casual role

---

## Project Structure

> ⚠ **Note:** Documentation for `utils/` and `auth.py` is complete. Other modules are currently being documented.
> ⚠ **Disclaimer:** This was my first experience with working on something so big with an OOP language so yeah, I

                   have used a lott  of functions in  places where classes would do a  better job. I'm working on
                   fixing that too!

## Deployment Overview

> All major modules are deployed separately:

| Component     | Role                                       | Deployment                        |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `auth.py`     | Main Discord bot runtime                   | Railway (Bot Host)                |
| `web.py`      | OAuth2 account linking + redirect handling | Railway (Web App)                 |
| `supaabse.py` | PP/Rank sync for all tracked users         | Pythonanywhere/ cron-job (Worker) |

## Local Setup(Linux/ MacOS)

Follow these steps to get a development instance of **osu!Arena** running locally.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12+**
- **Git**
- A **Supabase** project (Free tier works)
- **Discord Application** (Bot Token + Client ID)
- **osu! OAuth Application** (Client ID + Client Secret) x2 (one for background pp updater, one for oauth linker (read on for more detail))

### 1. Fork & Clone

Fork the repository to your GitHub account, then clone it to your local machine:

```bash
# Replace 'YOUR_USERNAME' with your GitHub username
git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Osu-Arena.git]
cd Osu-Arena
```

### 2. Python Environment Setup

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

1. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

1. Activate the environment (Linux/macOS)

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configuring .env

Create a file named `sec.env` in the root directory. Copy and paste the following template, filling in your specific API keys:

```bash

# --- Discord ---
DISCORD_TOKEN=      # Main authentication token for the Discord bot instance.

# --- osu! OAuth (Web/Linking) ---
AUTH_ID=            # osu! Client ID for handling the initial OAuth2 web linking flow.
AUTH_TOKEN=         # osu! Client Secret for the web linking flow.

# --- osu! API (Background Sync) ---
OSU_CLIENT2_ID=     # Secondary osu! Client ID for the background worker to sync players current_pp.
OSU_CLIENT2_SECRET= # Secondary osu! Client Secret for background worker to sync players current_pp

# --- Database ---
SUPABASE_URL=       # The API URL for your Supabase project
SUPABASE_KEY=       # The Supabase Service Role key for backend database access

# --- Security & Encryption ---
FLASK_SECKEY=       # Random string used to sign and secure Flask session cookies
SEC_KEY=            # Encryption key used to serialize Discord IDs in OAuth redirect URLs

```

### 4. Database Initialization

1. Log in to your Supabase Dashboard.

2. Go to the SQL Editor.

3. Open the file `supabase_schema.txt` located in the root of this repository.

4. Copy the contents at Sections #2 and #3 and run the query in Supabase to set up the required tables and RPC functions.

### 5. Running the Bot

You will need to run the components in separate terminal windows (make sure your virtual environment is activated in each):

Terminal 1: The Discord Bot

```bash
python auth.py
```

Terminal 2: The Web Server (OAuth)

```bash
python web.py
```

Terminal 3: The Background Sync (Optional) Only run this if you need to test live PP updates.

```bash
python supabase_sync.py
```
