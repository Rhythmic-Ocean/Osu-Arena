## 🧠 Commands (Help Menu)

The bot uses **slash commands** for a cleaner experience. Here’s what you can do:

---

### 🔗 `/link`  
Link your osu! account securely via OAuth2.  
_All users signed up before **June 18, 2025, 22:50 CDT** were linked manually._

---

### 📊 `/show [league]`  
Shows the table for a specific league.  
Examples:  
- `/show league:Bronze`  
- `/show league:Silver`  
- `/show league:Rivals`  

Available leagues:  
`Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Elite, Ranker, Master, Rivals`

---

### 📂 `/archived [season] [league]`  
View archived tables from previous seasons or finished challenges.  
- **season**: Season number (integer).  
- **league**: League name (e.g., Bronze, Silver, Gold, Rivals).  
- **Note**: `season:0` is the only valid value for `leag:Rivals`.  

Examples:  
- `/archived season:1 leag:Bronze`  
- `/archived season:0 leag:Rivals`  

Works only for **finished** seasons and challenges.

---

### ⚔️ `/challenge @user <pp>`  
Challenge a player in your league for a match.  
- Max **3 active** challenges  
- PP must be **250–750**  
- You can’t challenge the same player **more than once a day**  
- The challenged player gets a DM to accept/decline  

Example:  
`/challenge player:@Rhythmic_Ocean pp:700`

---

### ❌ `/revoke_challenge @user`  
Revoke a pending challenge you issued.  
- Only **unaccepted (pending)** challenges can be revoked  
- If the challenge has been accepted, it **cannot** be revoked  

Example:  
`/revoke_challenge player:@Rhythmic_Ocean`

---

### 🛠️ `!session_restart`  
Admin-only command to reset the current session and reassign users to leagues.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

### 🔧 Main Modules (in root)

- `auth.py` – **Main bot entrypoint**, handles bot startup, event handling, and async execution  
- `core_v2.py` – Core **utility logic** behind all commands (DB ops, user logic, challenge logic)  
- `monitoring.py` – Async process that **monitors ongoing rivalries** and announces winners  
- `supaabse.py` – Separate process to **poll and sync player data (pp, ranks)** to Supabase  
- `web.py` – Flask app handling **OAuth2 flow**, callback routing, and token handling  
- `core_web.py` – Web-specific helpers used by `web.py`

### 💬 Commands Folder

- `commands/` – Contains all bot `@bot.command()` implementations  
  - Relies on helper functions in `core_v2.py`
